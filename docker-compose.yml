# https://docs.docker.com/compose/yml/
# Each service defined in docker-compose.yml must specify exactly one of
# image or build. Other keys are optional, and are analogous to their
# docker run command-line counterparts.
#
# As with docker run, options specified in the Dockerfile (e.g., CMD,
# EXPOSE, VOLUME, ENV) are respected by default - you don't need to
# specify them again in docker-compose.yml.
#

services:
  # Path to a directory containing a Dockerfile. When the value supplied
  # is a relative path, it is interpreted as relative to the location of
  # the yml file itself. This directory is also the build context that is
  # sent to the Docker daemon.
  # 
  # Compose will build and tag it with a generated name, and use that image
  # thereafter.

    # Expose ports. Either specify both ports (HOST:CONTAINER), or just the
    # container port (a random host port will be chosen).
    #
    # Note: When mapping ports in the HOST:CONTAINER format, you may experience
    # erroneous results when using a container port lower than 60, because YAML
    # will parse numbers in the format xx:yy as sexagesimal (base 60). For this
    # reason, we recommend always explicitly specifying your port mappings as
    # strings.

    # (HOST:CONTAINER), or an access mode (HOST:CONTAINER:ro).
